- [#17408](https://dev.azure.com/Trustmarque-DevOps/_workitems/edit/17408) **Portal - Question list changes** Structured Evidence In Advance Submission This template is designed to be a walk-through tool giving guidance for completion as you go through. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the HM Inspectorate of Probation inspection standards and inspection manuals. The inspection manual and standards were sent as attachments to the announcement letter and are also available on our website. One section required please with the following text. The HMIP inspections portal allows the SPOC to upload documents relevant to the individual standards and key questions. Under each standard we have identified a set list of documents for submission. We ask that you only submit these documents, if any are not available state that in the Comments section. Please do not submit items that are not listed or submit any documents with further embedded documents in them. If further evidence is required the lead inspector will make a separate request during the planning meeting. If items are submitted using the portal that are not listed, the inspector may not take them into account. Evidence should typically be recent or current (normally produced within the last 12-18 months), unless it is a key policy that has been in place for longer. While you are uploading the evidence in each of the sections, none of this evidence is submitted to us until you click on the submit evidence button at the bottom of the screen. This means that you can collate and revise your evidence over a period of time, knowing that we will not be able to view this until you are ready for it to be submitted. In each section, there is an optional box entitled Comments. You may choose to use this box for any of the following: ◦ to describe or summarise the local context relevant to the individual question ◦ to mention additional documents that would be available if the lead inspector requires them ◦ to explain why some documents are not available. At the end of each section you must click on the save response box • Check you have uploaded all your documents, keeping to the limits suggested in each section. • Check you have made an entry in all the Comments boxes as required. Use the Submit Evidence in Advance button at the bottom of the screen, to make the final submission of your evidence. HEADING should be reworded as ‘Please only click ‘Submit Evidence in Advance once the evidence is complete.’ Submit Evidence in Advance button is fine as-is 1115
